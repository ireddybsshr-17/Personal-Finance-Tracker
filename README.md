# Personal-Finance-Tracker

Managing personal finances efficiently is a growing challenge for many individuals today. The Expense Tracker website I worked on aims to make this process easier by providing users with a seamless platform to track their spending habits. With features like income and expense recording, budget management, and financial analysis tools, the website helps users stay on top of their finances without the hassle of manual tracking.

● Developed a comprehensive Personal Expense Tracker app using the MERN stack. Implemented CRUD operations for real-time expense tracking, categorization, and analytics.

● Achieved a 95% user satisfaction rating as users reported improved budgeting habits and financial awareness through the app's intuitive interface and insightful data visualization.
